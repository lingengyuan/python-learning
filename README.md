# Python Learning

A small collection of practice scripts built while learning the Python basics. Each file focuses on a simple topic so you can run and experiment with them one by one.

## Getting Started
- Install Python 3.
- Run any script with `python3 <file_name>` from the project root.
- Scripts with spaces in their names need quotes, for example `python3 "Branch structure.py"`.

## What Each File Covers
- `helloworl.py`: first "hello world" print.
- `variable.py`: integers, booleans, strings, floats, type conversion, and character codes.
- `operators_demo.py`: arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical operations, and a Celsius-to-Fahrenheit calculation.
- `Branch structure.py`: conditional logic plus Heron's formula to validate triangle sides.
- `Loop Structure.py`: `for` loops, a number-guessing `while` loop, and a multiplication table.
- `List.py`: list creation, concatenation, mutation methods, enumeration, and a dice-roll counter using randomness.
- `functions_and_collections.py`: reusable functions, list comprehensions, dictionary updates, tuples, sets, and summary statistics.

## Notes
- The guessing game and triangle check require user input in the terminal.
- Feel free to tweak the examples and re-run them to see how the output changes.
